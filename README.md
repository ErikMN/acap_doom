# ACAP DOOM

id Software's classic FPS **Doom** for Axis network cameras. \
\
Running on **ARTPEC-7** and **ARTPEC-8** devices. \
Refer to your device manual to determine your platform. \
\
‚ö†Ô∏è Firmware should be **11.5** or later.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This application is **not affiliated** with Id Software or Axis Communications. \
> **Please read and respect the LICENSE** to ensure compliance.

This application is intended to be built on a Linux or macOS system.

## ‚úÖ Build Docker images

**[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and Make must be installed before proceeding.**

```sh
make dockersetup
```

This might take some time, as all the resources required for the application need to be built.

## ‚úÖ Build the ACAP

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE** that you will need a WAD file to play and install the ACAP. \
Please read the [**WAD File**](#wad-file) section below.

For ARTPEC-7 devices:

```sh
make armv7hf
```

For ARTPEC-8 devices:

```sh
make aarch64
```

This might also take some time, as we need to build both the application and the web UI.

## ‚úÖ Install the ACAP

‚ö†Ô∏è You will need to enable unsigned ACAPs on the Apps page: **Allow unsigned apps**

Run ```setuptarget.sh``` to create ```credentials.json``` (requires `jq` to be installed) \
Set your Axis device IP in ```credentials.json``` and:

```sh
source setuptarget.sh && make install
```

Otherwise, go to the device web interface at:

```html
http://<YOUR_DEVICE_IP>/camera/index.html#/apps
```

and select ```Add app``` \
Upload the correct ```.eap``` file to the device to install it.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the ACAP

Open the app website and press the **START** button.

## WAD file

WAD (which, according to the Doom Bible, is an acronym for "Where's All the Data?") \
is the file format used by Doom and all Doom-engine-based games for storing data.

The `WAD`-file used in ACAP Doom is the shareware version of Doom (`doom1.wad`, version 1.9, SHA-1 `5b2e249b9c5133ec987b3ea77596381dc0d6bc1d`).

`doom1.wad`, will automatically be downloaded when running ```make dockersetup``` \
When building the ACAP it will be copied to the project directory.

The WAD file to be included in the ACAP is specified in `package.conf` under ```OTHERFILES```. \
**üö® WAD SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THIS README FILE üö®**

More about `doom1.wad` here: <https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DOOM1.WAD>

## Expert users: Add your own WAD file

Place your WAD file in the following directory on the device:

```sh
/usr/local/packages/acap_doom
```

**Note:** Not all WAD files have been tested.

## Expert users: Development

Check available build commands and helpers:

```sh
make help
```

To just build the application binary for current arch:

```sh
// Will build with debug symbols:
FINAL=n make build

// Deploy debug binary to target:
FINAL=n make deploy
```

Build and deploy the web code (requires Node.js and Yarn to be installed):

```sh
make web

// Deploy the ACAP web to target:
make deployweb
```

Trace logs on current sourced target device (requires Python with paramiko and scp):

```sh
make log
```
